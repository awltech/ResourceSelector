# ResourceSelector

The Resource Selector is an extensible module that offers the possibility to select, through a user dialog box, any kind of resource from an Eclipse Project. It was initially used to display in the same dialog, all types from a projects classpath as well as all the UML types from uml models located in the same project. (Implementation is available as a sample of the project.)
